Re: Eileen Dover university application

Dear Eileen,

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) next year. I will answer your
questions one by one, in the following sections.

Starting dates

We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

First semester: 9 September 2016
Second semester: 15 January 2017
Third semester: 2 May 2017
